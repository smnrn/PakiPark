/**
 * models/index.js
 * ===============
 * Exports all Sequelize models.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISION — Loosely Coupled (No ORM Associations):
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * PakiPark uses a *denormalized / snapshot* approach for Booking and Review.
 * User, vehicle, and location data is copied into each booking row at creation
 * time (see userName, vehiclePlate, locationName, etc. columns).
 *
 * As a result:
 *   • NO Sequelize associations are defined here.
 *   • NO `include: [...]` (JOIN) is used anywhere in the application.
 *   • All booking reads are single-table index lookups — O(log n), no JOIN cost.
 *   • Historical records are self-contained even if a user/vehicle/location
 *     is later updated or deleted.
 *
 * Integer FK columns (userId, vehicleId, locationId, parkingSlotId) are kept
 * in the Booking model purely for referential integrity auditing and admin
 * tooling; they are never used for SELECT … JOIN in the app layer.
